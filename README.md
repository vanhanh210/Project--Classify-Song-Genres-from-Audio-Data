# Project: Classify Song Genres from Audio Data
 
In the "Classify Song Genres from Audio" project, I applied machine learning algorithms to classify songs into different genres.

My responsibilities included:

- Preparing the dataset.
- Splitting it into training and testing sets.
- Normalizing the data.
- Applying PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on the scaled data.
- Training decision tree and logistic regression models, and comparing their performances.
- Balancing the data for enhanced performance.Understanding model bias.
- Applying cross-validation to evaluate the models.
